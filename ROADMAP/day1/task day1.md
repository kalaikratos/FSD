**HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2: What's the Difference and Why It Matters**

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the standard protocol for communication on the World Wide Web. It allows clients (such as web browsers) and servers (such as web servers) to exchange messages, such as requests and responses, using a predefined format and syntax.

HTTP has evolved over the years, from its initial version HTTP/0.9 in 1991, to the most widely used version HTTP/1.1 in 1997, and to the latest version HTTP/2 in 2015. HTTP/2 is based on the SPDY protocol, which was developed by Google to improve the performance and security of web applications.

In this blog post, we will compare the main features and differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and explain why HTTP/2 is a better choice for modern web development.

**HTTP/1.1: The Limitations**

HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol, which means that all messages are encoded in plain text format, using ASCII characters. This makes it easy to read and debug, but also inefficient and prone to errors.

HTTP/1.1 uses a request-response model, which means that for each request from the client, the server sends back a corresponding response. However, HTTP/1.1 has some limitations that affect the performance and user experience of web applications, such as:

Head-of-line blocking: HTTP/1.1 allows only one request per TCP connection at a time, which means that subsequent requests have to wait until the previous response is received. This creates a bottleneck and increases the latency of the web page loading.
Multiple connections: To overcome the head-of-line blocking problem, HTTP/1.1 allows clients to open multiple TCP connections to the same server, usually up to six. However, this also increases the overhead and complexity of managing multiple connections, and consumes more resources on both the client and the server side.
Redundant headers: HTTP/1.1 messages include headers that contain metadata about the request and the response, such as the host, the content type, the cookie, etc. However, many of these headers are repeated in every request and response, which adds unnecessary bytes and wastes bandwidth.
Uncompressed headers: HTTP/1.1 does not compress the headers, which means that they are sent in plain text format, without any optimisation. This also contributes to the bandwidth consumption and the latency of the web page loading.

**HTTP/2: The Improvements**

HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, which means that all messages are encoded in binary format, using bits and bytes. This makes it more compact and efficient, but also harder to read and debug.

HTTP/2 uses a multiplexed model, which means that multiple requests and responses can be sent and received concurrently over a single TCP connection, using frames. This eliminates the head-of-line blocking problem and reduces the number of connections needed.

HTTP/2 also introduces several features and enhancements that improve the performance and security of web applications, such as:

Header compression: HTTP/2 uses HPACK, a compression algorithm that reduces the size of the headers by removing the redundancy and encoding them in binary format. This saves bandwidth and improves the speed of the web page loading.
Server push: HTTP/2 allows servers to proactively send resources to the client, without waiting for a request, using push frames. This can reduce the number of round trips and improve the user experience of the web page loading.
Stream prioritisation: HTTP/2 allows clients to assign priorities to different requests, using priority frames. This can help servers to optimise the delivery of the resources and improve the user experience of the web page loading.
Flow control: HTTP/2 allows both the client and the server to control the amount of data that can be sent and received over a connection, using window frames. This can prevent congestion and improve the reliability of the web page loading.

**HTTP/2: The Benefits**

HTTP/2 is designed to overcome the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and provide a faster, more secure, and more user-friendly web experience. Some of the benefits of HTTP/2 are:

Faster web page loading: HTTP/2 reduces the latency and the bandwidth consumption of the web page loading, by using multiplexing, header compression, server push, stream prioritisation, and flow control. This can improve the performance and the user satisfaction of the web page loading.
Simpler web development: HTTP/2 simplifies the web development process, by eliminating the need for some of the hacks and workarounds that were used to optimise the web page loading under HTTP/1.1, such as domain sharing, resource inlining, etc. This can reduce the complexity and the maintenance cost of the web development.
Better web security: HTTP/2 encourages the use of HTTPS, which is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts the communication between the client and the server, using SSL/TLS certificates. This can protect the web applications from eavesdropping, tampering, and spoofing attacks, and enhance the web security.

**Key Differences Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:**
Here are the high-level differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

Format: HTTP/1.1 works on a textual format, while HTTP/2 operates on a binary protocol.
Multiplexing: HTTP/1.1 suffers from “head of line blocking,” while HTTP/2 allows multiplexing, using one TCP connection for multiple request.




Header Compression: HTTP/2 uses HPACK for data compression, reducing the overhead of repetitive header information.
Server Push: HTTP/2 introduces the concept of Server Push, allowing servers to proactively push responses into client caches


**Conclusion:**

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are two versions of the same protocol that governs the communication on the World Wide Web. HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol that uses a request-response model, but has some limitations that affect the performance and user experience of web applications. HTTP/2 is a binary protocol that uses a multiplexed model, and introduces several features and enhancements that improve the performance and security of web applications.

HTTP/2 is a better choice for modern web development, as it offers faster web page loading, simpler web development, and better web security. However, HTTP/2 is not a replacement for HTTP/1.1, but a complement. HTTP/2 is backward compatible with HTTP/1.1, which means that clients and servers that support HTTP/2 can still communicate with those that support HTTP/1.1, using the same protocol.

**Question 2:**


**Understanding Objects and Internal Representation in JavaScript**

JavaScript, a versatile and widely-used programming language, relies heavily on objects to represent and manipulate data. Objects in JavaScript serve as a fundamental building block, enabling developers to create complex structures and organize code efficiently. In this blog, we'll delve into the world of objects, exploring their internal representation and the key concepts that make them so powerful in JavaScript.

**The Basics of Objects**

At its core, an object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs. These key-value pairs, also known as properties, allow developers to store and retrieve information. Unlike simple data types such as numbers or strings, objects provide a way to structure data in a more meaningful and hierarchical manner.

Here's a simple example of an object in JavaScript:

```javascript
let person = {
 firstName: "John",
 lastName: "Doe",
 age: 30,
 isStudent: false
};
```

In this example, `person` is an object with four properties: `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and `isStudent`. The values associated with these properties can be of any data type, and properties can even contain other objects, creating a nested structure.

**Internal Representation of Objects**

To understand how JavaScript internally represents objects, it's essential to grasp the concept of reference and memory allocation. When you create an object, JavaScript allocates memory to store its properties and values. Unlike primitive data types (e.g., numbers or strings), objects are reference types. This means that the variable holding an object doesn't store the actual data but rather a reference to the memory location where the object is stored.

Consider the following:

```javascript
let person1 = {
 firstName: "John",
 lastName: "Doe"
};

let person2 = person1;
```

In this example, `person2` doesn't create a new object. Instead, it references the same object as `person1`. Any changes made to `person1` will be reflected in `person2`, and vice versa. This behavior is a result of objects being reference types in JavaScript.

**Object Creation**

JavaScript provides multiple ways to create objects. The most common methods include object literals, the `Object` constructor, and constructor functions. Object literals, as shown in the previous examples, offer a concise syntax for creating objects. The `Object` constructor can be used to create an empty object, while constructor functions provide a way to create multiple objects with similar structures.

Here's an example using a constructor function:

```javascript
function Car(make, model, year) {
 this.make = make;
 this.model = model;
 this.year = year;
}

let myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
```

In this case, the `Car` function serves as a blueprint for creating car objects. The `new` keyword is used to instantiate a new object based on the constructor function.

 **Prototypes and Inheritance**

JavaScript employs a prototype-based inheritance model, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object in JavaScript has an internal link to another object called its prototype. If a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it finds the desired property or until it reaches the end of the chain.

This mechanism allows for a more efficient use of memory and promotes code reusability. Developers can create objects that inherit properties and methods from a shared prototype, reducing redundancy and promoting a cleaner code structure.

**Conclusion**

Understanding objects and their internal representation is crucial for becoming proficient in JavaScript. Objects provide a flexible and powerful means of organizing and manipulating data, and their reference-based nature influences how data is stored and accessed in memory. As you delve deeper into JavaScript development, a solid grasp of objects and their intricacies will empower you to create more robust and maintainable code.
